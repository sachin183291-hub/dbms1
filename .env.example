## Setup Instructions for Twilio:

1. Create a Twilio Account:
   - Visit https://www.twilio.com/console
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Verify your phone number

2. Get Your Credentials:
   - Account SID: Available in your Twilio Console dashboard
   - Auth Token: Available in your Twilio Console dashboard
   - Phone Number: Purchase a phone number from Twilio (free trial includes $15 credit)

3. Add to Environment:
   - Copy the credentials above
   - Create a .env.local file in the project root (if using Vite)
   - OR paste these into .env file

4. Testing:
   - In development mode, OTPs will log to the browser console
   - Click the OTP in console to copy it
   - For production, the SMS will be sent to the registered phone

## Note for Development:
If Twilio credentials are not configured, the application will:
- Generate the OTP
- Log it to the browser console
- Display a message "OTP has been prepared. Check browser console for development mode."
- This allows testing the OTP flow without SMS service

## Troubleshooting:
- If OTP is not sending, check browser console for error messages
- Ensure Twilio credentials are correct in .env
- Verify the phone number format (must include country code, e.g., +91 for India)
- Check Twilio account balance and phone number ownership
